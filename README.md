# Devops-Challenges

## Day 1

1. Create an AWS account.
2. Create an AWS Budget Alert for spending more than 3 dollars. You will be notified by AWS.
3. Create an IAM user. ( This is important, creating service in root account is not the best practice. always create a user and then create your services in new user account. )
